[New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

## Requirements

Start using the tool now by opening and compiling the project in Visual Studio 2012 or 2013. Update Project Debug properties to correctly locate add-in build path in /addinpath command line argument. Run project in Debug mode. When Operations Dashboard application starts, edit an operation view that contains a map widget with a valid datasource, choose the DamageAssessmentSummary Widget from the Add Widget dialog box, and click OK. Configure the widget to point to appropriate fields from the datasource and click OK.

Alternatively, build the project, and upload the .opdashboardaddin file from the build output directory to ArcGIS Online, and then download using Manage Add-Ins in Operations Dashboard.
